        <h4><strong>Returns Policy for FAB BAG Monthly Subscriptions: 100% Happiness or Money-Back Guarantee</strong></h4>
        <p>Every month's FAB BAG is curated with a lot of care and our beauty experts go to great lengths to ensure that you really love your monthly surprises! However, in case of a rare situation where you are not happy with your month's bag, you can ship the bag back to us and we will refund the pro-rata amount for that month in form of the store credit. At FAB BAG, we value the love and trust you place in us and promise to do everything possible to make your beauty shopping as magical an experience as can be. Few things you should know about our money-back guarantee:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Intimation:</strong>
                The return must be communicated to us via an email to crew@fabbag.com within 48 hours of delivery of your FAB BAG
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Return:</strong>
                In order to avail a refund, the complete bag has to be returned back to us. Returns of individual products from the bag are not accepted. The bag and its products must reach us in an unused and undamaged state for us to process the refund. Shipping costs for sending the bag back to us will be borne by the member.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Refund</strong>
                All refunds under the "100% Happiness or Money Back Guarantee" will be given in the form of store credit of pro-rata value which the member can use across any product or subscription on our online store. For example: In case you had purchased a 6-month subscription for 2,899/- then you will receive store credit for 2,899/6 = 483/- (Cash-on-Delivery charges are not refundable)
            </li>
            <br>
        </ul>

            <h4><strong>Subscription Cancellation</strong></h4>
           <p>
               <strong>Ongoing Subscriptions : </strong>
               Please note that while all Fab Bag subscriptions are cancellable, you will have to send us an email on crew@fabbag.com with reasons for the cancellation before the 25th of the month to cancel your subscription from a particular month. For timely shipping and operational reasons, we will not be able to cancel a particular month's subscription if the request is received after the 25th of the month as your bag would have already been processed by then. Once we receive your request, we will cancel your subscription from the next month's bag and refund you the difference between what you paid for your subscription and the billable amount for the months where you received your bag.
           </p>
           <p>
               <strong>New Subscriptions:</strong>
               We accept cancellation requests of new orders only if intimated via email within 48 hours from the time the order is placed. You can cancel the order by contacting our Customer Support team via email at crew@fabbag.com. In the case of prepaid orders, the amount will be refunded to you and should reflect in your account in 7-10 working days. Please note that if the cancellation request is sent after 48 hours of placing the order, the amount will be refunded only in the form of FAB BAG store credit after the order is cancelled, we will only be able to cancel the order from the next month's bag as the current month's order would have already been processed.
           </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Billable Amount:</strong>
                    Is calculated on a pro-rata basis of the next lesser-duration subscription rate prevailing at the time of your order. For example, if you had bought a 6-month subscription for 2,899/- and wished to cancel it after your fourth bag, then you would be billed for the four bags in the following manner: 1,599/- (3-month subscription rate) x 4/3 = 2,132/- 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Special Instructions for Free Gift Offers:</strong>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Cancellations after Shipping:</strong>
                    For cancellation requests that come in after the bag has been shipped, a 'Shipping & Handling' Fee of Rs. 100/- will be adjusted against the refundable amount.
